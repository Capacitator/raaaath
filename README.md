# Raaaath 
*A chariot of Indiaâ€™s voice in the AI world.*

# What?
Community driven foundational models to power 1.5 Billion Indians. To power every voice no matter how faint. 
Exact structure to follow soon

# Why ?
Tired of seeing Big tech models dominate the cutting edge models and the voices of the underrepresented languages and dialects being drawn out by mainstream languages.

## ðŸ§  How?

By turning Indiaâ€™s greatest strengths into fuel:
- **Our people**: Millions ready to contribute, review, teach
- **Our pride**: In our languages, our stories, our accents
- **Our spirit of jugaad**: Making the best from little

We'll build smarter, smaller, faster â€” **for Bharat**, by Bharat.

## ðŸš« Don't Join

If you donâ€™t believe in the **power of a common person**  
If you want fancy slides over fieldwork  
If you doubt that revolutions can start from a dorm room

## âœŠ Else...  
Welcome to the chariot. Let's ride.
