*A chariot of Indiaâ€™s voice in the AI world.*

## ðŸš€ Mission  
Build a lean, inclusive, and community-powered Indian LLM that reflects the voices, dialects, and culture of Bharat.  
We aim to make language AI accessible and relevant to the 1.4B people of India â€” not just English speakers or tech elites.

## ðŸ”¥ Vision  
- Bring together developers, linguists, and citizens to build a truly **Indic model**.
- Train using **efficient techniques** â€” LoRA, quantization, distillation â€” to keep costs low and reach broad deployment.
- Focus on **low-resource Indian languages** and dialects ignored by global models.
- Build an **open community** where everyone contributes â€” with data, code, feedback, or voice.

## ðŸ‘¥ Join the Movement  
Weâ€™re just starting out â€” and need:
- Python coders who want to learn and build
- People who speak Indian languages to help review/correct
- Community leaders to help spread the word
