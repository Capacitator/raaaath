# 🚣 Raaaath Roadmap: India’s Chariot to Open Multilingual LLMs

*A chariot of India’s voice in the AI world.*

---

### ✅ Strengths

* Community-first and culturally grounded
* Strong mission-driven identity
* Pragmatic start using LoRA and small models
* Clear phased structure retained

## 🔹 Phase 0 — Strategy & Core Planning *(May–July 2025)*

**Goal: Establish technical foundation and rally early contributors**

* [x] Define mission, vision, name (Raaaath)
* [ ] **Technical Blueprint**

  * Base model: shortlist (LLaMA 3.2, Qwen2.5, Mistral)
  * Tokenization for Devanagari, Tamil, Bengali, etc. 
  * Quantization plan (4-bit QLoRA, GPTQ, AWQ)
* [ ] **Evaluation Metrics & Benchmarks**

  * IndicGLUE + BLEU/ROUGE for translation tasks
  * Community-crafted QA/eval sets per language
* [ ] **Data Strategy**

  * Prioritized languages: Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi
  * Licensing: Ensure public domain or Creative Commons data
  * Annotated correction workflows + versioned curation
* [ ] Community Infra:

  * Launch GitHub repo, Telegram, Discord
  * Contributor guide and task board

### 💻 Use Accessible Lab Equipment

* [ ] Setup multi-GPU training pipeline for 4050/4060 GPUs
* [ ] Use bitsandbytes, Flash Attention 2, and DeepSpeed
* [ ] Use LoRA/QLoRA for fine-tuning
* [ ] Integrate Weights & Biases or TensorBoard for monitoring

## 🛠️ Phase 1 — Language Core *(Aug–Oct 2025)*

**Goal: Prototype multilingual model with top 3 Indian languages**

* [ ] Curate 10M+ tokens for Hindi, Tamil, Bengali

  * News, Wikipedia, Common Crawl, Bharatvani, crowd-sourced forums
  * Synthetic data via backtranslation and GPT-4 prompting
* [ ] Model Dev:

  * Fine-tune a 7B open base on this data
  * Evaluate against custom benchmarks
* [ ] Release:

  * Model weights and inference code
  * Hugging Face card + license
* [ ] Publish detailed training process write-up

---

## 💬 Phase 2 — Community Training Loop *(Nov 2025–Jan 2026)*

**Goal: Expand languages and gather training signals from community**

* [ ] Language expansion: Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam
* [ ] Launch web demo: feedback for generated answers
* [ ] Launch RLHF loop:

  * Crowdsource ranking and correction
  * Reward top contributors
* [ ] Model Alignment:

  * Cultural alignment policies
  * Content filtering, safety measures

---

## 🚀 Phase 3 — Optimization & Deployment *(Feb–May 2026)*

**Goal: Production-grade multilingual Indian LLM**

* [ ] Train distilled and quantized variants (3B, 1B)
* [ ] Optimize for:

  * Edge (mobile/IoT)
  * Streaming chatbot inference
* [ ] Inference Infra:

  * Rate-limited APIs with monitoring
  * Cache frequent queries
  * Web/mobile SDK
* [ ] Launch reference apps:

  * Chatbot
  * Code-switching assistant
  * Summarizer/translator

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Ecosystem & Global South Network *(June 2026+)*

**Goal: Establish long-term sustainability and cultural impact**

* [ ] Open-source training framework
* [ ] Contribute to Indic NLP research and conferences
* [ ] Build governance board + language councils
* [ ] Adapt Raaaath for Africa, Latin America
* [ ] Advocate AI for public good in policy spaces

---

## 🔎 Competitive Edge

* India-first
* Common-man usable
* Community-powered
* Light-weight & deployable models

## ⏳ Next 30 Days

* Base model decision
* Community Discord/Telegram
* Apply for cloud credits
* Draft compute cost estimation
* Create a blog/video to share vision

---

## ⚠️ Risk Management

* **Data bias**: Use diverse sources, run audits
* **Burnout**: Encourage async & part-time contribution
* **Safety**: Implement harmful content filters
* **Legal**: Open data only; no scraping behind paywalls
